# Ukiah Senior Center - Donation Portal

**🚨 IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR NEW CHAT:** This project was created by your Chief Software Engineer in October 2025 by strategically copying and adapting files from the admin.ukiahseniorcenter.org workspace. The admin system is a sophisticated task management application with "90% hidden complexity" fractal zoom architecture - this donate portal extracts the best UI patterns but focuses solely on donation flow.

## 🎯 Project Context & History

### Original Admin System Analysis
- **Complex Architecture**: Progressive disclosure, multi-dimensional views, "LEGO flexibility"
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15.5.3, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Yarn Berry
- **Key Insight**: Admin system was overkill for simple donation page, but excellent foundation

### Strategic Simplification Done
- ✅ **Foundation Copied**: Config files, Next.js structure, essential components via terminal
- ✅ **Branding Preserved**: All logos, favicons, Senior Center assets copied
- ✅ **Tech Stack Maintained**: Same stack for consistency (Node Modules, not PnP, Corepack not TurboPack)
- ✅ **Components Simplified**: ErrorBoundary, LoadingStates, Modal, Toast for payment flows
- ✅ **Types Focused**: Donation-specific types instead of task management complexity

### Current State
- **Foundation Complete**: Ready for Zeffy integration and deployment
- **Payment Processor**: Zeffy (NOT Zephy - typo was corrected) 
- **Fallback Option**: PayPal integration prepared
- **Deployment Target**: Vercel (CEO will create project)

## 🌟 Features

### Current Features (v0.1.0)
- ✅ **Modern UI**: Clean, accessible donation interface based on admin system's patterns
- ✅ **Dual Payment Options**: Zeffy (primary) + PayPal (fallback) - placeholders ready
- ✅ **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design using proven admin CSS patterns
- ✅ **Processor Tip Education**: Clear guidance on optional Zeffy tips
- ✅ **Senior Center Branding**: All assets copied, consistent visual identity
- ✅ **Impact Messaging**: Shows how donations help the community
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust ErrorBoundary and loading states
- ✅ **Professional Polish**: Same design system as admin dashboard

### Planned Features (Next Implementation Phase)
- **Zeffy Integration**: Live payment processing widget embed
- **Donation Amounts**: Preset and custom amount options
- **Recurring Donations**: Monthly/yearly giving options  
- **Donor Recognition**: Thank you pages and confirmation emails
- **Analytics**: Donation tracking and reporting via donations.ts utility
- **Success Flows**: Completion states and receipt generation

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js 15.5.3**: React framework with App Router (proven in admin system)
- **React 19**: Latest React with modern hooks patterns
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with donation-specific interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first styling with custom design system from admin
- **Yarn 4.10.2 (Berry)**: Package management with Node Modules configuration

### Key Configuration
- **Node Modules**: Uses nodeLinker configuration, NOT Plug and Play (PnP)
- **Corepack**: Package management (NOT TurboPack which is for bundling)
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration matching admin system
- **ESLint**: Next.js + TypeScript rules for consistency

### Architecture Philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: Single-purpose donation flow (vs admin's multi-dimensional complexity)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant using admin's proven patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized loading, minimal dependencies vs admin's comprehensive feature set

## 🚀 Getting Started
